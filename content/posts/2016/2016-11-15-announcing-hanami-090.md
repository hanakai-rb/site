  New hanami-model engine based on ROM.
  Database automapping, data integrity for entities, experimental associations, native PostgreSQL types.
---

We rewrote `hanami-model` from scratch with an engine based on <a href="http://rom-rb.org">ROM</a>.

The result is impressive: it's faster and more robust.

## Features

### Database Automapping

But there is more, all the **mapping boilerplate is gone**, now using entities and repositories is much **easier**.

```shell
% bundle exec hanami generate model book
      create  lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb
      create  lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb
      create  spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb
      create  spec/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository_spec.rb
```

This is the generated entity:

```ruby
class Book < Hanami::Entity
end
```

While this is the generated repository:

```ruby
class BookRepository < Hanami::Repository
end
```

Then we generate the migration:

```shell
% bundle exec hanami generate migration create_books
      create  db/migrations/20161113154510_create_books.rb
```

Let's edit the migration with the following code:

```ruby
Hanami::Model.migration do
  change do
    create_table :books do
      primary_key :id
      column :title,      String
      column :created_at, DateTime
      column :updated_at, DateTime
    end
  end
end
```

Now we need to prepare the database to use it:

```shell
% bundle exec hanami db prepare
```

We're ready to use our repository:

```ruby
% bundle exec hanami console
irb(main):001:0> book = BookRepository.new.create(title: "Hanami")
=> #<Book:0x007f95ccefb320 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>"Hanami", :created_at=>2016-11-13 15:49:14 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 15:49:14 UTC}>
```

### Entities Data Integrity

When using a SQL database, an entity setups an **internal schema**, which is derived **automatically** from the table definition.

Imagine to have the `books` table defined as:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    title text,
    created_at timestamp without time zone,
    updated_at timestamp without time zone
);
```

This is the corresponding entity `Book`.

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb
class Book < Hanami::Entity
end
```

---

Let's instantiate it with proper values:

```ruby
book = Book.new(title: "Hanami")

book.title      # => "Hanami"
book.created_at # => nil
```

The `created_at` attribute is `nil` because it wasn't present when we have instantiated `book`.

---

It ignores unknown attributes:

```ruby
book = Book.new(unknown: "value")

book.unknown # => NoMethodError
book.foo     # => NoMethodError
```

It raises a `NoMethodError` both for `unknown` and `foo`, because they aren't part of the internal schema.

---

It can coerce values:

```ruby
book = Book.new(created_at: "Sun, 13 Nov 2016 09:41:09 GMT")

book.created_at       # => 2016-11-13 09:41:09 UTC
book.created_at.class # => Time
```

An entity tries as much as it cans to coerce values according to the internal schema.

---

It enforces **data integrity** via exceptions:

```ruby
Book.new(created_at: "foo") # => ArgumentError
```

If we use this feature, in combination with [database constraints](/guides/migrations/create-table#constraints) and validations, we can ensure a **strong** degree of **data integrity** for our projects.

### Associations (experimental)

Hanami finally ships with associations.
We postponed this feature for long time mainly because we didn't want to replicate ActiveRecord API.
That is a complex beast that took years to get stable.
Its proxy loader design (`post.comments` to load comments) doesn't fit Hanami vision of explicitness.

To design an API that is both explicit and reduces the boilerplate is a hard challenge.
But today we can share with you a preview of this experimental feature.

```ruby
class AuthorRepository < Hanami::Repository
  associations do
    has_many :books
  end

  def create_with_books(data)
    assoc(:books).create(data)
  end

  def find_with_books(id)
    aggregate(:books).where(authors__id: id).as(Author).one
  end
end
```

We can create with a single SQL command the parent and the children:

```ruby
repository = AuthorRepository.new

author = repository.create_with_books(name: "Alexander Dumas", books: [{title: "The Count of Monte Cristo" }])
  # => #<Author:0x007f8a08130968 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>"Alexander Dumas", :created_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :books=>[#<Book:0x007f8a0812b260 @attributes={:id=>1, :author_id=>1, :title=>"The Count of Monte Cristo", :created_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC}>]}>
```

The default find, doesn't preload the associated records:

```ruby
found = repository.find(author.id)
  # => #<Author:0x007f8a07971ce0 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>"Alexander Dumas", :created_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC}>

found.books
  # => nil
```

It requires an explicit preload operation:

```ruby
found = repository.find_with_books(author.id)
  # => #<Author:0x007f8a040a6cf8 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>"Alexander Dumas", :created_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :books=>[#<Book:0x007f8a040a5970 @attributes={:id=>1, :author_id=>1, :title=>"The Count of Monte Cristo", :created_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC}>]}>

found.books
  # => [#<Book:0x007f8a040a5970 @attributes={:id=>1, :author_id=>1, :title=>"The Count of Monte Cristo", :created_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-14 20:52:24 UTC}>]
```

### PostgreSQL Types

`hanami-model` now supports natively most common PostgreSQL data types such as: `UUID`, `Array`, `JSON(B)`

```ruby
Hanami::Model.migration do
  up do
    execute 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"'

    create_table :project_files do
      column :id, 'uuid', null: false, default: Hanami::Model::Sql.function(:uuid_generate_v4)
      column :name, String
    end
  end

  down do
    drop_table :project_files
    execute 'DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS "uuid-ossp"'
  end
end
```

```ruby
ProjectFileRepository.new.create(name: "source.rb")
  # => #<ProjectFile:0x007ff29c4b9740 @attributes={:id=>"239f8e0f-d764-4a76-aaa7-7b59b5301c72", :name=>"source.rb"}>
```
