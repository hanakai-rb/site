It’s week 3 of our [sponsorship drive](/blog/2025/06/03/become-a-hanami-dry-and-rom-patron)! This week is a special one, because I’ve been out in the commuity, and I have a field report to share!

## Tim on Rooftop Ruby

Earlier this month I had the pleasure of sitting down [for a proper chat](https://www.rooftopruby.com/2108545/episodes/17321855-44-hanami-and-chippy-buddies-with-tim-riley) (not just [a cameo](https://www.rooftopruby.com/2108545/episodes/16928379-41-there-s-no-r-in-naur)) with my friends Collin and Joel on [Rooftop Ruby](https://www.rooftopruby.com/2108545). It was a wide-ranging affair, featuring not just the usual serving of English _gastronomy_, but also the hows and whys behind our sponsorship drive, and where we might take things in the future. It was a good one. [**Listen now!**](https://www.rooftopruby.com/2108545/episodes/17321855-44-hanami-and-chippy-buddies-with-tim-riley)

Huge thanks to Collin and Joel for making this happen. I had very limited time to squeeze in this recording, and they were extremely accommodating.

## Hanami on the Baltic shore

Last week I had another fun Ruby experience, travelling all the way from Australia to Latvia to attend the wonderful [Baltic Ruby](https://balticruby.org)!

We had a couple of Hanami events at the conference. The first was part of Baltic Ruby’s _OSS Expo_, an unstructured afternoon where conference-goers and open source groups can come together. In our case, we had multiple folks try Hanami for the first time (and even fix some documentation bugs), fellow contributor [Krzysztof Piotrowski](https://github.com/krzykamil) continue his work on a `db rollback` command, and [Ismael Celis](https://ismaelcelis.com) created [the world’s first event-sourced calculator on Hanami](https://bsky.app/profile/ismaelcelis.com/post/3lrj5ltfvlc2a). _No notes._

We even had a familiar face stop by for a chat!

While not technically part of the OSS expo, during the conference we also found some help from friend-of-the-framework [Charles Nutter](https://www.headius.com)! Charles reviewed the hanami/hanami test suite and helped identify [how we can get to green on JRuby](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/pull/1524). Thank you Charles for your help! I think Hanami on [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org) could make for a formidable combo of performance and code clarity, and I’m excited to make this part of our standard offering.

## A new talk from Tim

I had the honour of delivering Baltic Ruby’s closing keynote. This time I talked about my life with Ruby and how a “black sheep” feeling led to the Hanami, Dry and Rom we have today. I also publicly launched our sponsorship drive and shared a delicious teaser about one of the next steps for ecosystem.

The talk was titled _What I Talk About When I Talk About Ruby_, and we had Haruki Murakami serve as both [inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running) and spirit guide across the journey. This was another new narrative direction for me, after [Ricky Martin](https://www.rubyevents.org/talks/livin-la-vida-hanami) and [Ultima IV](https://www.rubyevents.org/talks/keynote-quest-of-the-rubyist-by-tim-riley), and I think it turned out great. Thank you to [Sergey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergyenko/) and [Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krynitsky) for the opportunity!

In another first, this talk even had a _soundtrack_, with sweeping musical accompaniment provided by the conference’s live band. Folks, this is why you go to in-person conferences.

For the rest of you, [the talk’s RubyEvents page](https://www.rubyevents.org/talks/keynote-what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-ruby) is already up, and we’ll be sure to share this again once the video is live.

## Sponsorship updates

(What is all of this? [Read our sponsorhip site to learn more.](https://sponsor.hanamirb.org))

In the week since our [last update](/blog/2025/06/11/hear-from-our-founding-patrons), we’ve had one person become a community patron and support our work on Hanami, Dry and Rom. Thank you very much, [Andreas Wagner](https://github.com/whysthatso)!

This means we’re still sitting at $27.5k:

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜<br>
_**$27.5k of $70k** — 39% to our goal…_

Our first milestone is $40k. That’s not far off! If we can find a couple more business patrons, and maybe a dozen or so community patrons, we’ll get there! I’m sure we can get there. Can you help us?
