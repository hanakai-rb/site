It’s week 6 of our sponsorship drive!

Let’s make sure you’re all caught up. So far, we have:

- [Launched the sponsorship drive](/blog/2025/06/03/become-a-hanami-dry-and-rom-patron)
- [Heard from our founding patrons](/blog/2025/06/11/hear-from-our-founding-patrons)
- [Shared a podcast and field report](/blog/2025/06/20/field-report-from-riga-and-the-rooftop)
- [Met Tim and Sean](/blog/2025/06/26/meet-tim-and-sean)
- [And addressed elephant in the room, Rails](/blog/2025/07/11/hanami-and-the-elephant-in-the-room)

There’s a lot of words across those posts. So today I want to share something different, something _visual_. Behold, cuteness!

![A preview of our new logos](/blog/assets/2025-07-24-the-look-of-things-to-come/new-logos-preview.png "A preview of our new logos")

Here you have your very own preview of the new faces we’re creating for Hanami, Dry and Rom.

I’m _so_ excited for this. These logos will unify our projects while allowing each to maintain its own identity. They’re also the visual representation of [the culture we’re building](/blog/2025/07/11/hanami-and-the-elephant-in-the-room#it-all-comes-back-to-people), of kindness, curiosity and care — and also, delight! Ruby is fun, after all!

We’ll have more to share on this in due course, but if there’s one thing I already know, it’s that the future is looking bright (and cute!). We’d love to have you join in. 🌸

A huge thank you to [Aaron Moodie](https://aaronmoodie.com) for his work in bringing this to life!

We’re nearly at the end of our inaugural sponsorship drive. In my next post, I’ll come back to wrap everything up. See you then!
