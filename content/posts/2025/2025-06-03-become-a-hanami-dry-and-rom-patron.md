  Help us build a diverse future for Ruby.

Dear #rubyfriends — today we announce the beginning of a new era for [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org), [Dry](https://dry-rb.org) and [Rom](https://rom-rb.org). We are establishing paid, ongoing maintenance for the very first time.

I’m very proud of what we’ve built over our last decade of nights and weekends: an entire ecosystem of impressive breadth: from standalone libraries in Dry, to a powerful persistence toolkit in Rom, all the way to Hanami, the batteries-included framework experience that ties it all together.

Now it’s time to take our work to the next level, to prepare our ecosystem for the next decade and beyond. We need your help to make it happen. [**We need you and your businesses to become patrons of Hanami, Dry and Rom.**](/sponsor)

We’re aiming to raise USD $70k/year, ongoing. At $40k, this will enable 1 day/week of maintenance work [from me](https://github.com/timriley), plus establish a small reserve for community and promotional activities. At $70k, this will enable another day/week from my core teammate [Sean Collins](https://github.com/cllns).

With this funding, we can:

- Continue to make improvements, fixes and releases of all gems, including renewed attention on Dry and Rom.
- Improve the Hanami developer experience. Better CLI, more helpful errors, easier testing approaches, even a language server.
- Write new learning material and documentation.
- Create a new Hanami community hub to bring users together from across the whole ecosystem, and better support new contributors to our projects.

As of today, we’re already on the way!

Thanks also to [**Ruby Central**](https://rubycentral.org), who are serving as fiscal host for our business patrons.

[**We’d love for you to join them.**](/sponsor) Hanami patrons receive several direct benefits:

- Private chat with Hanami maintainers.
- Priority attention on your issues or requests.
- Your logo and link on the brand new Hanami website.

Most important of all, you’ll be creating a healthy and diverse future for Ruby. The Hanami team works at the forefront of exploring new avenues for Ruby apps. Our continued success can help bring about a new kind of inclusivity in Ruby, for people and tooling both.

Today’s announcement marks the beginning of Hanami’s first ever _sponsorship drive!_ Each week over the next 6 weeks, we’ll be sharing more about our work and plans, and we’ll be celebrating each and every one of you who makes a stand and chooses to contribute to a diverse Ruby future.
