  It’s week 2 of our sponsorship drive. Time to meet the people helping us build the future of Ruby, including our new community patrons!
---

Last week we [launched our sponsorship drive](/blog/2025/06/03/become-a-hanami-dry-and-rom-patron), and today we’re back with some updates!

## New community patrons!

Since our launch, we’ve had a slew of community patrons support us through [our GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hanami)!

Thank you to [@karloscarweber](https://github.com/karloscarweber), [@bjeanes](https://github.com/bjeanes), [@josephinehall](https://github.com/josephinehall), [@tombruijn](https://github.com/tombruijn), [@theomelo](https://github.com/theomelo), [@caius](https://github.com/caius) and [@andrew](https://github.com/andrew)! ❤️

A special extra thank you to [@gdonald](https://github.com/gdonald), a sponsor since the beginning of this year, and [@BridgeCare](https://github.com/BridgeCare), supporting us since July 2023!

Thank you also to [@kigster](https://github.com/kigster) and [@Z2Flow](https://github.com/Z2Flow) for making one-time donations.

I think all of this is enough to warrant an update to our fundraising bar:

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜<br>
_**$27.5k of $70k** — 39% to our goal!_

In this group, we see the power of our community. [We would love to see you join them!](/sponsor) You can help us build a better Ruby.

## Hear from our founding business patrons

Now let’s hear from our founding patrons, the people who helped us get this whole thing off the ground in the first place.

> Ruby has a problem: it’s mostly a monoculture around Rails. Merb and Sinatra provided valuable app framework options in the past, I believe we need new options for the future.

That’s [Mike Perham](https://www.mikeperham.com). Mike [became our very first patron](https://www.mikeperham.com/2025/01/17/sponsoring-hanami/) earlier this year. Mike’s support was what made me believe we had a real chance to fund Hanami/Dry/Rom development in the first place. Thank you for your confidence, Mike! We’ll do everything we can to bust the monoculture.

Over to [Brandon Weaver](https://github.com/baweaver):

> In Ruby diversity is our greatest strength, whether that be the people, the ideas, or the technologies we use. Ruby is not just one framework, nor is it just one person, it is a community of passionate people pushing the boundaries of what’s possible not just as individuals, but as a collective. I am happy to continue to fund efforts building upon that vision of the future.

Brandon represents the best of Ruby. He gives of himself in every way, and brings an irreplaceable _je ne sais quoi_ to our community. Check out his [RubyConf 2024 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDepeodE0i4) for an example. In this talk you’ll also see Brandon pushing the boundaries and exploring a range of functional programing concepts, which fits very well with our own technical pursuits, and many of which you can use yourself with [dry-monads](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-monads/)! Brandon stands up for what he wants to see in the Ruby community, and was another quick supporter of our work. Thank you Brandon!

Next we have Joshua Wood, of [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/?utm_source=hanami&utm_medium=paid-referral&utm_campaign=founding-patron):

> Honeybadger has been monitoring Ruby apps since 2012, and we’ve always believed in giving back to the open source community that made our business possible. We’re proud to sponsor a framework and team that is working to make Ruby better for everyone. Hanami is leading the way.

What Josh and the team have built is not only an amazing product and bootstrapping story, but also a nexus of support for everything good in Ruby. I’d only known Josh on the internet until 2023, when I arrived in San Diego for my first US RubyConf. Josh was one of the folks who made me feel very welcome. Thank you Josh for everything you and Honeybadger do for Ruby, now including your support of Hanami!

Another friend I made in an earlier US visit (shout out to Southeast Ruby 2017) is Ernesto Tagwerker, of [FastRuby](https://www.fastruby.io/):

> At FastRuby we believe in the value of diverse and inclusive communities. With our yearly contribution to Hanami we are investing in a framework that brings positive change to our beloved Ruby ecosystem. We envision a future where projects like Hanami, Roda, Sinatra, Cuba, and Padrino push the boundaries of what’s possible in Ruby.

Fittingly, Ernesto’s talk at that conference was titled _Open Source: When Nights & Weekends Are Not Enough_. We hear you, Ernesto! In his own non-night, non-weekend time, Ernesto has built up [OmbuLabs](https://www.ombulabs.com) and [FastRuby.io](https://www.fastruby.io), two top-tier Ruby consultancies. We’re honoured to have them throw their support behind Hanami. Thank you Ernesto!

Lastly, let me share some words from Roy Tomeij of [AppSignal](https://www.appsignal.com/):

> At AppSignal, we believe in sustainable open-source software and are happy to contribute to Hanami’s development by enabling others to continue the great work they do. In turn, this allows us to keep providing APM services that smoothly integrate with Hanami. Everybody wins.

While AppSignal had already been in our orbit, with Tom de Bruijn [improving Hanami Controller instrumentation](https://github.com/hanami/controller/pull/446) last year, I had never met Roy before I contacted him about our fundraising. That Roy recognised the value of our work and so quickly stepped up with financial support gives me hope that we can find even more like-minded Ruby businesses out there. Thank you for leading the way, Roy!

## Over to you!

We’re getting closer. As we enter into the second week of our sponsorship drive, can you or your business [join the ranks of Hanami’s founding patrons?](/sponsor) I’ll be back with another post next week, and I’d love to be singing your praises then!
