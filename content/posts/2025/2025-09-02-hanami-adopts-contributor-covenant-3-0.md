Our community is the most precious part of Hanami. When you pick up Hanami, we want to make sure you have a great time. This is why we place our community values front and centre [on our home page](https://hanamirb.org):

> We want the Hanami community to be a welcoming place for people who bring kindness, curiosity, and care. A place where people of all backgrounds and experience levels can feel respected, and can share and grow. A place for people to be proud of, and feel safe within.

It’s also why we govern our community spaces under the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct. This is the gold standard for community codes of conduct, and it’s served us well [for over ten years](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/commit/54ce22376146efcd8a76c0b281e5bb74a3ff16e1).

**Today we’re delighted to adopt the new [Contributor Covenant 3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/),** released just last month. This new version brings [a number of improvements](https://ethicalsource.dev/blog/contributor-covenant-3/):

> Contributor Covenant 3.0 is designed to be more adaptable to different kinds of communities, both online and offline. It is written with clearer, less US-centric language, intended to be easier to understand and translate. The enforcement guidelines section has been reimagined as “Addressing and Repairing Harm,” reflecting an alignment with principles of restorative justice, including finding ways to safely reintegrate someone back into a community after an incident occurs.

We’re pleased that this new version is more approachable for our worldwide community. We also welcome the focus on restorative justice. The examples of how people can make genuine amends to grow and rejoin a community are clear and well explained.

These changes won’t affect how we interact day-to-day in our already lovely community, but do give us better tools for the rare times when conflicts need thoughtful resolution.

Thank you to the [Organization for Ethical Source](https://ethicalsource.dev) for their work on this new version!

You can find our instance of the Contributor Covenant on [our community page](https://hanamirb.org/community/#code-of-conduct).
