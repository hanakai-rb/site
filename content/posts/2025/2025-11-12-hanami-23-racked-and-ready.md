  Our biggest release yet. Rack 3, resource routes, and so much more.
---

Today we are excited to announce Hanami 2.3! With this release, we unlock Rack 3, introduce resource routes, and deliver dozens of quality-of-life improvements that make building with Hanami smoother than ever.

## Built for Rack 3

We are excited to bring Rack 3 support to Hanami! We now support both versions 2 and 3, so you can use whichever version of Rack suits your situation. We encourage you to upgrade Rack when you can, and we’re happy that Hanami can help you on this path.

When you upgrade to Rack 3, check out the [Rack 3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/UPGRADE-GUIDE.md). Hanami already handles the essential changes for you, but you may need to update your app code if you’re working with Rack request/response details.

## Streamlined from route to response

More than just Rack, we’ve refined all aspects of our routing and request handling layer. The biggest change is the return of resource-based routing.

To set up RESTful routes, you’d previously add the following lines:

```ruby
# Previously...
get "/books", to: "books.index", as: :books
get "/books/:id", to: "books.show", as: :book
get "/books/new", to: "books.new", as: :new_book
post "/books", to: "books.create"
get "/books/:id/edit", to: "books.edit", as: :edit_book
patch "/books/:id", to: "books.update"
delete "/books/:id", to: "books.destroy"
```

Now, all you need is one:

```ruby
# Now! 🥰
resources :books
```

Resource routing is integrated with every aspect of routing. Resources can be customized, nested, and combined with scopes and ordinary routes. [Learn more here](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v2.3/routing/overview/#resource-routes).

The improvements don’t stop there! With this release:

- Route scopes can be given custom name prefixes.
- Routes can be named with a prefix that precedes scope prefixes.
- Router runtime performance is considerably improved for large numbers of routes.
- Multipart form and JSON request bodies are parsed by default.
- Action format and media type config is [clearer and more flexible](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v2.3/actions/formats-and-media-types/).
- You can access your subdomains via `Request#subdomains`, and [configure your TLD length](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v2.3/actions/request-and-response/#request).
- When you add `'nonce'` to your content security policy, nonces are automatically added to script and stylesheet tags.
- CSRF tokens are loaded from the `X-CSRF-Token` header in addition to request params.

## DX in the details

We’ve also improved many more of your day-to-day interactions with Hanami:

- `hanami new` now initializes a Git repository for new apps. You can also provide `--skip-view` to skip the view layer, as well as `--gem-source`, so you can use [gem.coop](https://gem.coop) from the get-go.
- New apps get a helpful `bin/setup` script, as well as an improved README with a handy list of first steps.
- New apps also receive a `bin/hanami` binstub, so you can invoke `bin/hanami` without requiring a `bundle exec`.
- Run `hanami db rollback` to easily rollback a database migration.
- Add your own methods to `hanami console` via your own modules: add `config.console.include MyModule` in your app class.
- Prefer Pry to IRB? Make it the default with `config.console.engine = :pry`.
- The console now prints a one-time warning when you access the `keys` for an un-booted app or slice. You can also chose to boot your app preemptively with `hanami console --boot`.
- The default `Rakefile` will automatically load custom tasks from `lib/tasks/`.
- [View context](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v2.3/views/context/) classes are generated by default, so you can more easily see where to put custom view logic.
- Run `hanami generate` command within a slice directory and the generated file will target that slice automatically.

We’ve made dozens more small improvements and fixes. Check out [the changelogs](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to learn more.

## Try Hanami 2.3

There’s never been a better time to try Hanami. For this release we’ve made our [getting started guide](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v2.3/introduction/getting-started/) more concise and easier to follow. Now you can get up and running faster than ever!

Why don’t you give it a try? Your first Hanami app is just a few commands away:

```shell
$ gem install hanami
$ hanami new my_app
$ cd my_app
$ bin/hanami dev
$ open http://localhost:2300
```
