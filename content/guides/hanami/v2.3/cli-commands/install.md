## hanami install

This command installs third-party dependencies (Ruby gems, NPM packages) and setups additional Hanami gems that provide code reloading, rspec, integrations.

This command is executed automatically by `hanami new`. In case you'll run into third-party dependency problems, execute it.

    $ bundle exec hanami install
