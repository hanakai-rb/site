title: Scopes
---

A scope is the object that determines which methods are available to use from within the template. The [standard scope](//page/templates) provides access to template locals (exposed values), partial rendering, as well as the building of custom scopes.

With a custom scope, you can add your own behavior around a template and its particular set of locals. These, along with [parts](//page/parts), allow for most view logic to move away from templates and into classes you can reuse, refactor according to typical object oriented approaches, as well as test in isolation.

## Defining a scope class

To provide custom scope behavior, define your own scope classes in a common namespace (e.g. `Scopes`) and [configure that](//page/configuration) as your view's `scope_namespace`:

```ruby
class MyView < Dry::View
  config.scope_namespace = Scopes
end
```

Each scope class must inherit from `Dry::View::Scope`:

```ruby
module Scopes
  class MediaPlayer < Dry::View::Scope
  end
end
```

## Building scopes

Build a scope by using the `#scope` method from within a template, or on a [part](//page/parts) or scope object.

```ruby
scope(:media_player)
```

Scopes can be passed their own set of locals:

```ruby
scope(:media_player, item: audio_file)
```

## Scope class resolution

Scope classes are looked up based on the configured `scope_namespace` and the name you pass to `#scope`.

So for a `scope_namespace` of `Scopes` and scope built as `:media_player`, the `Scopes::MediaPlayer` class will be looked up.

If a matching scope class cannot be found, the standard `Dry::View::Scope` class will be used.

## Rendering partials

You can render a partial using a scope with the standard `#render` method:

```ruby
scope(:media_player, item: audio_file).render(:media_player)
```

This rendered partial will have access to all the scope's methods, as well as its locals (see below).

The scope will infer the partial name by rendering without any arguments:

```ruby
scope(:media_player, item: audio_file).render
```

This will use the scope's name for the name of the partial. In the example above, this is the equivalent of calling `#render(:media_player)`.

You can also render partials from within your scope class' own methods:

```ruby
class MediaPlayer < Dry::View::Scope
  def audio_player_html
    render(:audio_player)
  end
end
```

## Accessing locals

From within a scope class, or a template rendered with that scope, you can access the locals by their names.

For example, from a template:

```erb
<!-- e.g. accessing the `item` when rendered via scope(:media_player, item: audio_file).render -->
<%= item.title %>
```

Or from a custom scope class:

```ruby
class MediaPlayer < Dry::View::Scope
  def display_title
    # `item` is a local
    "#{item.title} (#{item.duration})"
  end
end
```

You can also access the full hash of locals via `#_locals` (or `#locals` as a convenience, provided there is no local named `locals`).

This is useful for providing default values for locals that may not explicitly be passed when the scope is built:

```ruby
class MediaPlayer < Dry::View::Scope
  def show_artwork?
    locals.fetch(:show_artwork, true)
  end
end
```

## Accessing the context

In your scope classes, you can access the [context object](//page/context) as `#_context` (or `#context` as a convenience, provided there is no local named `context`).

Scopes also delegate missing methods to the context object (provided there is no local with that name).

For example:

```ruby
class MediaPlayer < Dry::View::Scope
  def image_urls
    # item is a local, and asset_path is a method defined on the context object
    [item.image_url, asset_path("standard-media-artwork.png")]
  end
end
```

## Memoizing methods

You may choose to memoize expensive operations within a scope to ensure they only run once.

## Configuring a scope for a whole view

Aside from building custom scopes explicitly, you can also specify a scope to be used when a view renders its own template.

You can specify the scope as a direct class reference:

```ruby
class MyView < Dry::View
  config.template = "my_view"
  config.scope = Scopes::MyView
end
```

Or if you have a scope namepace configured, you can use a symbolic name and a matching scope will be looked up:

```ruby
class MyView < Dry::View
  config.template = "my_view"
  config.scope_namespace = Scopes
  config.scope = :my_view
end
```

## Providing a custom scope builder

To fully customize scope lookup and initialization, you can provide a replacement scope builder:

```ruby
class MyView < Dry::View
  config.scope_builder = MyScopeBuilder
end
```

Your scope builder must conform to the following interface:

- `#initialize(namespace: nil, render_env: nil)`
- `#for_render_env(render_env)`
- `#call(name = nil, locals)`

You can also inherit from `Dry::View::ScopeBuilder` and override any of its methods, if you want to customize just a particular aspect of the standard behavior.
