# Site

This is the upcoming [Hanakai](https://hanakai.org) website. Itâ€™s still a work in progress.

## Organizing development

We track our development entirely using [issues on this repo](https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues). Orgnize your issues according to these main issue labels: [area-backend][backend-label], [area-design][design-label] and [area-content][content-label].

[backend-label]: https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea-backend
[design-label]: https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea-content
[content-label]: https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea-design

## Setup

Make sure you have Ruby and Node.js installed (see [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) for expected versions), then run:

```
bin/setup
```

To see common commands for operating the site:

```
bin/setup help
```
