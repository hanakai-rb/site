# Site

This is the upcoming [Hanakai](https://hanakai.org) website. It’s still a work in progress.

## Organizing development

We track our development entirely using [issues on this repo](https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues). Orgnize your issues according to these main issue labels: [area/backend][backend-label], [area/design][design-label] and [area/content][content-label].

For the site’s initial launch, we’re tracking our work [in this project board][launch-project].

[launch-project]: https://github.com/orgs/hanakai-rb/projects/2/views/1
[backend-label]: https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea%2Fbackend
[design-label]: https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea%2Fcontent
[content-label]: https://github.com/hanakai-rb/site/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea%2Fdesign

## Setup

Make sure you have Ruby and Node.js installed (see [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) for expected versions), then run:
